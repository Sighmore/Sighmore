# Android Developer (Kotlin) from Kenya

👋 Hello, I'm Simon Kuria

🔭 I’m currently working on a Gemini-powered ChatBot—an Android app that harnesses the capabilities of Gemini AI.

🌱 I’m currently learning more about Kotlin and Android's clean architecture to enhance my app development skills.

🤝 I’m looking for help with Flutter (Dart) and Swift to broaden my mobile development expertise.

💬 Ask me about Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, SQL, and Android Development! I'm here to help.
